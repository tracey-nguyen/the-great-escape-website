# The Great Escape Website

The Great Escape is an online booking website for an escape room. This website will allow users to search for escape rooms, choose an escape room and book an escape room. It has a minimalistic design with a monochromatic black colour palette. It mainly uses a single column layout as it makes it easier to have a responsive design when designing for mobile devices and the three columns are used for listing the games in the rooms page, reviews and the footer.
